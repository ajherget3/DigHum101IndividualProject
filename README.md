# What Makes Music Popular?

![spotify logo](Spotify_Logo_CMYK_Green.png)

In this project, I analyzed 3 Spotify datasets from Kaggle. These are available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

I compared song descriptor data between songs from December 2020 and April 2021. I specifically looked at the songs with a popularity score of 90 or above. The decriptors I looked at were song length, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and tempo. Popular songs were found to be more danceable, and higher energy than the average from all songs in each dataset. I also compared artists popularity scores with their follower counts. Unfortunately, I was not able to put my datasets in the repository because they are too large.
